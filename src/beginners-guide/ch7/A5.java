// NOTE - You can prevent a class from being inherited by preceding its declaration with **final**.
// NOTE - Declaring a class as **final** implicitly declares all of its methods as **final** too.
// NOTE - It is ILLEGAL to declare a class as both **abstract** and **final** since an abstract is
// incomplete by itself and relies upon its subclasses to provide complete implementation.
