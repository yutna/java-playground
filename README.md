# Java Playground

Here is a repository for storing examples and exercises done while studying Java. 
Besides serving as a backup, it is also used as a reference or to revisit notes 
and records that I have kept.

## Prerequisite

I use these tools when practicing Java. If you need to run any file examples in 
this project, make sure to install these tools before you begin.

- [Java JDK Development Kit 21.0.3][0]
- [IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition][1]

## Book references

Here is a list of what I have read, including examples and exercises I have 
done, derived from these books.

1. [Java: A Beginner's Guide, Tenth Edition][3]
2. [Java: The Complete Reference, Thirteenth Edition][4]
