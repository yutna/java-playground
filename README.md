# Java Playground

This is a self-learning Java programming language repository. I use this repo to
practice Java and as a reference for future Java projects.

## Prerequisite

I use these tools when practicing Java. If you need to run any file examples in 
this project, make sure to install these tools before you begin.

- [Java JDK Development Kit 21.0.3][0]
- [IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition][1]

## Book references

All code examples in this project that I learned came from these books.

1. [Java: A Beginner's Guide, Tenth Edition][3]
2. [Java: The Complete Reference, Thirteenth Edition][4]
