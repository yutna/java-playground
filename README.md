# Java Playground

Here is a repository for storing examples and exercises done while studying Java.
Besides serving as a backup, it is also used as a reference or to revisit notes
and records that I have kept.

## Prerequisite

I use these tools when practicing Java. If you need to run any file examples in
this project, please ensure that these tools are installed before you begin.

- [Java JDK Development Kit 21.0.3][0]
- [Visual Studio Code + Extension Pack for Java][1]
- [Code Runner Extension][2]

## Run the code examples

Since all the examples in the books are code snippets, and for simplicity's sake, I set this project to [lightweight mode][5] instead of a full Java project in standard mode. In this mode, you cannot run the Java files directly via VS Code; you need to run them using the Code Runner extension instead.

## Book references

Here is a list of my readings, along with examples and exercises I have
completed, taken from these books.

1. [Java: A Beginner's Guide, Tenth Edition][3]
2. [Java: The Complete Reference, Thirteenth Edition][4]
